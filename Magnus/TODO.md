- check bat for table collisions:
	- in Aim
	- in HitSearcher
	- generic hit prevention
- simulate cameras input detection instead of 100% accurate ball trajectories
- something more graceful than AimByCoords when possible
- continuous hit searching based on dynamic input
- fix using more than MaxForce in Aim implementations
- save game history to:
	- replay slowly or from other view
	- debug
	- record a video
- control camera in a more usable way (for instance, drag instead of just moving the mouse)
